# STANDUP 01 - 2/9/2023 TEAM Le-v-eL


General Update and Intro
========================
Hello, we are Team Le-v-eL. We are a team of 4 students from the University of massachusetts Boston.
 We are working on a project for the course CS410: Introduction to Software Engineering. Our team members are:
 * Jeremy
 * Woody(L) 
 * Sammed
 * Shiva(L)
Advisor: Mahsa.
Talked to Mahsa to get a better understanding of the project. 
Voted to use Github for sourcecode management and Trello Board for task management .

Draft of Requirements
=====================
The Goal of this project is a platform that will allow users/researchers to test thier machine graphical perception algorithms on benchmark datasets.
From the Goal statement, we have the following requirements:
* User Management: The platform should have a mechanism for registering and authenticating users, such as a sign-up and login process.
* Algorithm Testing: The platform should have a mechanism for users to upload their machine graphical perception algorithms and run them on the benchmark datasets.
* Results Display: The platform should display the results of the algorithm tests, such as accuracy and performance metrics.
* Leaderboard: Comparison: The platform should allow users to compare their algorithms with others to see how they stack up against the competition.
* Access to benchmark datasets repository. (who can upload datasets)
* User-friendly interface: The platform should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and understand for researchers and users with different technical backgrounds.
* Data import options: The website should support multiple data import options, such as CSV, Excel, and API, to allow users to easily upload and work with their own data sets.
* Interactive visualizations: Visualizations should be interactive and allow users to explore data by zooming, panning, and hovering over data points to view additional information.
* Responsiveness: The website should be optimized for different devices and screen sizes, to ensure that visualizations look good and are easy to interact with on all devices.
* Feedback: The platform should have a feedback window to collect feedback from users in a timely manner.

For technologies, we propose
* For the first version of the project we will be using HTML, CSS, JS.


Current Questions / Problems / Something you need
=================================================
* is this platform specifically for machine graphical perception algorithms or can it be used for other algorithms as well?
* what kind of standardized visualization benchmark datasets are we expected to get?
* Do we need a database system to manage our datasets?
* what are the metrics that we are going to use to compare the algorithms?
* what is the expected performance of the platform? (how many users, size of average benchmark dataset, leaderboard specifications, etc.)

List of Working Packages with responsible Student and Completion Dates
